## Overview
This project aims to predict students' mathematics scores based on various factors influencing their performance. By analyzing data related to students' academic performance, parental education levels, meal consumption, writing and reading scores, and whether or not they have received tuition, we employ machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. 
The project utilizes various technologies and methodologies to enhance the prediction accuracy, ensuring a robust analysis of the factors affecting students performance.

The project follows a systematic approach to predict students' mathematics scores:

1. **Dataset**: The dataset, located in the `notebook` folder, contains features related to students' performance and external factors influencing their mathematics scores.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial analysis involves visualizing distributions and identifying patterns to understand feature impacts on scores.

3. **Data Processing**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with categorical encoding, numerical scaling, and missing value handling for data integrity.

4. **Model Training**: Multiple machine learning algorithms are trained, and hyperparameter tuning is performed using techniques like Grid Search to optimize performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Performance is assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to ensure prediction accuracy.

6. **Predictive Pipeline and Flask Application**: A predictive pipeline is developed for seamless predictions, alongside a Flask app for user interaction, enabling input of features for score predictions.

### Azure Cloud  
Azure Cloud is used as the deployment platform for hosting the application. It provides scalability, reliability, and seamless integration with GitHub Actions, enabling efficient application delivery to end users.

### GitHub Actions  
GitHub Actions is leveraged to automate the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. It monitors changes in the repository and automatically builds, tests, and deploys the application to Azure, ensuring rapid and reliable updates.

### Workflow  
The CI/CD workflow is triggered by pushes or pull requests to the `main` branch. It includes the following steps:
- **Build**: The application is prepared for deployment by setting up the required environment.
- **Test**: Automated tests are run to validate code functionality and ensure stability.
- **Linting**: Code quality is checked using tools like Flake8 or pylint to catch errors and enforce coding standards.
- **Deploy**: After passing all checks, the application is deployed to Azure Cloud, making the latest version available to users.
